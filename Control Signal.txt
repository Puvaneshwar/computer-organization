The operation of the processor’s hardware components is governed by control signals.
These signals determine which multiplexer input is selected, what operation is performed
by the ALU
It is instructive to begin by recalling how data flow through the four stages of the
datapath.
The interface between the processor and the memory and the control signals associated
with the instruction register 
Two signals, MEM_read and
MEM_write are used to initiate a memory Read or a memory Write operation. When
the requested operation has been completed, the interface asserts the MFC signal. The
instruction register has a control signal, IR_enable, which enables a new instruction to be
loaded into the register. During a fetch step, it must be activated only after the MFC signal
is asserted.
the setting of the control signals
depends on:
• Contents of the step counter
• Contents of the instruction register
• The result of a computation or a comparison operation
• External input signals, such as interrupt requests
Instructions that handle data include Load, Store, and all computational instructions. They
perform various data movement and manipulation operations using the processor’s datapath,
whose control signals
 Once an instruction is loaded
into the IR, the instruction decoder interprets its contents to determine the actions needed.
At the same time, the source registers are read and their contents become available at the
A and B outputs of the register file. As mentioned earlier, inter-stage registers RA, RB,
RZ, RM, and RY are always enabled. This means that data flow automatically from one
datapath stage to the next on every active edge of the clock signal.
The desired setting of various control signals can be determined by examining the
actions taken in each execution step of every instruction. For example, the RF_write signal
is set to 1 in step T5 during execution of an instruction that writes data into the register file.
It may be generated by the logic expression
